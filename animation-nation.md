AKTA has UX, Design, Engineering
Top notch mobile experiences
We use animation to enhance our experiences

# Overview
- Why is animation important?
- What can animation provide?
- How do you create great animations?

^
Animation takes extra time. We need to know why its important

# [fit] PURPOSE
## Why is animation important?

---

# The physical world
- Rich with sensory input
- Inputs help give us context
    + Visual
    + Audible
- Instant feedback
- Constantly reacting to these inputs

---


# The real world is engaging

^
any activity you do provides feedback
Going to a concert
Riding a bike
We are here to talk about mobile

# You want to create an engaging mobile experience

---

# The mobile phone itself is NOT engaging

^
We had cell phones for years
Remember flip phones?
Those were not engaging

---

## its a piece of glass...

---

# Steamroll the real world onto a piece of glass

^
Mobile is like trying to take the real world and bottle it up
Taking experiences typically done in person and putting them on a screen

---

# Example

^
lets look at an example of taking a physical engaging experience and making it mobile
an example of the things we lose when we move to mobile

---

# Engaging
## Hail a cab on the street

^
Sights and sounds of the street
Standing on the edge of the curb trying not to die
Its a rush!

---

# Not Engaging
## Tapping a piece of glass

---

# What does this mean?

---

# Translating to and from a 2d medium is really hard

^
Lose a ton of what makes the real world engaging
Most users dont have their sound on
We have huge restrictions on the sensory input we can provide

---

# Animation is important

---

# [fit] POSSIBILITIES
## What can animation do?

---

# Words and images alone can not always express everything we want

---

# Example

---

# Facebook

![right fit](images/facebook.png)

^
Facebook has a fleet of native mobile apps
Millions of users per day

---

# Facebook Paper

![right fit](images/paper.png)

^
Removed their branding and design almost entirely
They made a completely separate app and changed their model
Added super high quality feelings to their app with ANIMATION

---

# Animation provides...
## Feedback & Context

---

# Feedback

---

## Feedback shrinks the gap between the digital and physical world 

^
Users expect immediate and constant feedback just like they get in the real world
Press a button for an elevator it lights up to let you know
Apple just built a trackpad that doesnt have a button but FEELS like a button
Many mobile apps today dont properly address this

---

# Context

^
Trying to make them feel like they arent crossing a boundary

---

## Context

![fit right](animations/material-context.gif)

- Eases the journey
- Indicates a change in 
- Focus is difficult to convey on a ~5 inch screen

^
Ease the journey as they experience your product

# Key Properties of Animation

- Timing
- Choreography
- Easing

---

# Timing

---

## Timing
- Dont slow things down
- Adjust your duration accordingly
- Multiple elements can animate for different durations

^
Try different things until you find timing that feels right

---

# Choreography

---

## Choreography
- Spatial awareness is important
- Related elements should behave in a similar manner
- Shared elements can animate into place

^
The screens are flat but your design isnt - obey the laws of physics

---

# Easing

---

## Easing
- Things need to feel less robotic and more natural
- Adjust the speed of items as they animate
- http://easings.net/


^
Treat items as if they had mass or weight to them
